# Advent of Code Stats

Find out which Advent of Code puzzles are the easiest and hardest, and track people's progress through time.

This API is built with Django REST Framework.

The start point of this app is the `get_data.py` script, which scrapes the Advent of Code website to collect the data.
This should only be done once per day during the contest - please respect Eric's wishes not to overload the website with requests!
